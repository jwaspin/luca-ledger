  "lucaBio": "Luca Pacioli (c. 1445 - 1517), an Italian mathematician and Franciscan friar, is widely regarded as the \"Father of Accounting\" for his seminal work, Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalit√†, published in 1494. This comprehensive treatise introduced the double-entry bookkeeping system, revolutionizing financial record-keeping and laying the foundation for modern accounting practices. Pacioli's contributions extended beyond accounting, as he made significant advancements in mathematics and geometry, authoring numerous books on these subjects. His legacy extends far beyond his time, as his work continues to influence the fields of accounting, mathematics, and finance to this day.",
